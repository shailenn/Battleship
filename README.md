# Battleship

This is a 2 dimensional array daemon game using Tkinter framework in Python

Total no of moves = 25 

Rules to win the game are 

In 25 moves player have to guess the location of all the 3 ships. 

3 ships are arranged in a random manner in 4 different ways
       (1) Horizontal
       (2) Vertical
       (3) Left Diagonal
